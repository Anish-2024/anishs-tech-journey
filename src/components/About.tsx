                  My journey began as a curious BCA student at Mangalore University, where I discovered my passion for technology and innovation. Today, as an MCA student at NMAMIT, I've evolved into a well-rounded tech enthusiast who thrives at the intersection of academics, family values, and competitive sports.

                  What sets me apart is my unique blend of technical expertise and leadership experience. I've dived deep into AI technologies, cybersecurity protocols, and Flutter development, creating projects that solve real-world problems. From developing an AI Virtual Mouse that revolutionizes computer interaction to building feedback systems that connect communities, I believe technology should make life better for everyone.

                  Beyond coding, I'm a natural leader who has captained teams and refereed competitive matches. My sports journey taught me discipline, teamwork, and resilience â€” qualities that make me a better developer and collaborator. Whether I'm debugging code late at night or strategizing on the badminton court, I bring the same dedication and analytical thinking to everything I do.

                  I'm constantly learning, always curious, and ready to take on challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible in tech and beyond.
